Exercises in concurrent haskell.

## compilation & execution

* **Examples 1-5** are intended to be compiled directly with ghc (`ghc example.hs`) and executed as a regular executable.
* **Example 6** uses external modules, so in order to make my life easier, it is a stack project. To compile: `stack build`, to execute: `stack exec geturls-exe`.
